* First of all thanks to Sean for the article on NodeJS app deployment on Docker http://seanmcgary.com/posts/deploying-a-nodejs-application-using-docker
* This provides an implementation of the same. I plan to extend this later on to support multiple processes so that I can run MongoDB and NodeJS together
* This assumes you have Docker installed and running
* Deploy and Run Helloworld App 
* Step 1: Build "docker build -t <username>/my-nodejs-webserver ."
* Step 2: Run "docker run -p 8080:8080 <username>/my-nodejs-webserver"
